# (CAPS) Code Academy Parcel Service

# Overview:

A real-time service that allows for vendors, such as restaurants, to alert a system of a package needing to be delivered, for drivers to instantly see whatâ€™s in their pickup queue, and then to alert the vendors as to the state of the deliveries (in transit, and then delivered).

# Development Process
Current Phase: Socket.io (phase 2)

Phase 1: Event Driven Applications
Using built-in Node.js events to simulate realtime package delivery changes

Phase 2: Socket.io
Replace Node Event Pool with socket.io
Allows web connectivity
Cleaner event handling

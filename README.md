# (CAPS) Code Academy Parcel Service

# Overview:

A real-time service that allows for vendors, such as restaurants, to alert a system of a package needing to be delivered, for drivers to instantly see whatâ€™s in their pickup queue, and then to alert the vendors as to the state of the deliveries (in transit, and then delivered).
